# BTW Map Markers
Adds Map Marker flags that can be placed anywhere in the overworld to add colored markers to in game maps. Or placed anywhere for decoration.

The recipe is shapeless consisting of paper and either a stick(shaft) or any type of wood moulding. Dye can be applied to any flag to change colors. In a cauldron, 16 flags can be dyed with a single dye for added efficiency.
